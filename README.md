# Open Street Map Application

This app parses Open Street Map Project data and offers a GPS like service to its user. You can zoom in and observe named locations on the map and find shortest paths from any two points on the map. To select a start location, click on a location on the map. To select an ending location, click again. Clicking one more time after this clears both the start and end location. When you have both a start and end location selected, click "Get Directions" to find the shortest path between the two.

## Usage

The app takes one command line argument, the name of the '.osm' file to be parsed. The one included, 'usb.osm', is a map of Stony Brook University and the surrounding area.
