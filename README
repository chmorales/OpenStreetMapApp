Overview

On launch, the main frame of the application will mostly be occupied by the map panel, 
where users can drag the mouse to pan around the map and zoom in and out using the 
scroll wheel. Other than the panel, the main frame will have a toolbar located above 
the map panel, which will store buttons for searching the OSM via text and for getting 
directions. When directions are being displayed, a side panel will appear 
(BorderLayout.WEST) to house the “Directions” user interface.

Directions
Users can access directions in one of two ways, both involving the “Directions” button 
located on the toolbar. If a user has already placed their pin on the map (clicked on 
a point in the map) and then hit the “Directions” button, the “Directions” side panel 
will appear and prompt for a start location. Once the start location has been set, 
the “Directions” side panel will display step by step directions for the specified path. 
	
The other scenario is when the user has not clicked on the map yet and has no pin set 
on the map panel and then clicks the “Directions” button. In this scenario, the panel 
will show up with a text field for a start location and an end location, both to be 
specified by the user. Once both are entered, the “Directions” panel will show step 
by step directions for the specified path. 

“Drive There” Mode
When the user activates “Drive There” mode, the map panel will clearly highlight the 
path of the directions specified by the user. It will also update the user’s location 
as they progress along the path, as well as rerouting directions if they stray too far.
